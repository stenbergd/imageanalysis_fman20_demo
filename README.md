# Image Analysis FMAN20 Demo Code ported to Python

FMAN20 is an image analysis course at LTH, Lund University. The course web site is here: http://www.ctr.maths.lu.se/course/newimagean/

As an LTH alumnus I decided to audit the course for educational purposes (and because it's fun!) using the open material from the course web site.

For educational purposes, a number of illustrative demo scripts were provided to run in MATLAB. However, MATLAB is not freely available to everyone outside academia.

To this end, I ported several of the demo scripts to Python 3 using NumPy and SciPy functions as stand-in replacements for MATLAB equivalents.

The original source code for MATLAB was developed by Professor Kalle Åström and is available at:
