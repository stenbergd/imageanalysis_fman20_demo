# Image Analysis FMAN20 Demo Code ported to Python

FMAN20 is an image analysis course at LTH, Lund University.

For educational purposes, a number of illustrative demo scripts were developed to run in MATLAB.

As an LTH alumnus I decided to audit the course for educational purposes (and because it's fun!). However, MATLAB is not freely available to everyone outside academia.

To this end, I ported several of the demo scripts to Python 3 using NumPy and SciPy functions as stand-in replacements for MATLAB equivalents.

The original source code for MATLAB was developed by Professor Kalle Åström and is available at:
